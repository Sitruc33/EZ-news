The bundle.js and index.html are the only things you need to run the website. Index.js is the underlying code that Webpack uses as a source/entry point. 
The newsApi.js is a seperate file that I run everytime I want to add an article the firebase database. It's still a work in progress as eventually that process will be run automatically. 
The website as a whole is still being updated with new features but will be redone once I learn React this upcoming semester (1/9/2024)
